Workshop 4 Reflection

This workshop helped me understand several key OOP concepts:

1. Constructor and Destructor Implementation:
- Learned how to create multiple constructors with different parameters
- Understood the importance of proper memory management through destructors

2. Dynamic Memory Management:
- Practiced allocating and deallocating memory for char* content names
- Used helper functions like alocpy() and freeMem() to manage memory safely

3. Current Object Reference:
- Implemented methods returning *this for method chaining
- Understood how to maintain object state through member functions

4. Class Design:
- Learned to implement validation logic for object states (usable/unusable)
- Practiced encapsulation by using private helper methods

The most challenging part was implementing the pour() methods correctly while maintaining object states and handling content validation.
