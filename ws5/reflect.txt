This workshop helped me understand several key OOP concepts:

1. Operator Overloading Implementation:
- Learned how to implement different types of operators (unary, binary, conversion)
- Understood the importance of const member functions and reference parameters

2. Type Conversion Operators:
- Implemented bool, int, and double conversion operators
- Practiced proper validation and state checking in conversions

3. Member vs Helper Functions:
- Learned the difference between member and non-member operator overloading
- Understood when to use friend functions for binary operations

4. Account Class Design:
- Implemented validation for different account states (valid/invalid/new)
- Practiced safe fund transfer operations between accounts

The most challenging part was implementing the fund transfer operators (>> and <<) while ensuring proper validation and state management of both accounts involved.
