In this workshop, I enhanced my understanding of C++'s Rule of Three by implementing the copy constructor, copy assignment operator, and destructor for the Numbers class. 
I learned to manage dynamic memory safely, ensuring no memory leaks occur during object copying or destruction. 
Implementing file I/O operations and overloading stream operators improved my ability to handle data persistence and user interaction. 
The exercise of resizing dynamic arrays taught me efficient memory management techniques. Overall, this workshop solidified my grasp of object-oriented programming principles, particularly in resource management and operator overloading.
