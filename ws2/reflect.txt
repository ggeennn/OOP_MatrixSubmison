# Reflection on Workshop #2

In this workshop, I learned several important programming concepts, including function overloading, dynamic memory allocation (DMA), and the use of compound types. These concepts are crucial in C++ programming, helping me better understand memory management and designing flexible program structures.

## Learning Outcomes

1. **Function Overloading**: I implemented multiple `getInt` functions that perform different operations based on parameter types and counts, enhancing code readability and flexibility.

2. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: I learned to use `new` and `delete` for dynamic memory management, particularly in the `reverse` function, which allocates an array based on user input.

3. **Compound Types**: I created functions to manage its instances, improving my understanding of data organization and reference passing.
