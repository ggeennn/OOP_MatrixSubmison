Workshop 3 Lab Reflection

In this workshop, I learned about credit card validation system implementation using C++ classes. The main challenges I encountered were:

1. Implementing proper dynamic memory management for the cardholder's name using the provided cstr utility functions
2. Ensuring all validation rules were correctly applied in the validate() function
3. Understanding the importance of proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

The most valuable learning outcome was understanding how to use class encapsulation to maintain data integrity and how to properly handle dynamic memory allocation in C++.
